        <h2>History of LunchBox</h2>
        <b><p>The team at LunchBox were all freshmen at Drexel University studying Computer Science and Information Systems. They all had a common goal and came together to create this web application. As inexperienced college freshmen, the team wanted to be able to cook for themselves since dining hall food is not great and have a space to share ingredients that they have made themselves in their dorms. Join other young adults by using LunchBox, the web app that helps you create a healthy balanced meal.</p></b>

                            <p> I'm from Somerset, NJ but originally from Poland. Outside of going to classes and doing work I enjoy cooking, walking around the city, and of course watching Netflix. At Drexel I am majoring information systems with a minor in technology innovation management. At LunchBox I am the project manager. My favorite recipe at the moment is the <a target="_blank" HREF="https://therecipecritic.com/2015/02/cherry-cheesecake-brownies/"> Cherry Cheesecake Brownies!</a></p>

                        <p>From Philly, PA born and raised. I am majoring in information systems and just trying to make it through life as calmly as possible. Outside of school, I enjoy baking, volunteering at the library, and traveling around the city. I believe that life is too meaningless if one isn't up and going. For LunchBox, I work as the data analyst and status coordinator.

                        <p> Currently studying computer science with a minor in software engineering and Chinese and I am the developer and support manager for LunchBox. But aside from STEM based stuff, I like to paint, volunteer with the clubs on campus, and discovering good places around to eat in Philadelphia or New York City. Favorite thing toeat right now is probably a good hefty bowl of<a target="_blank" HREF="http://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/easy-stove-top-macaroni-cheese-60350">macaroni and cheese</a> from Grey Dog in New York and while their recipe isn't online, this one is really close to it!</p>

                        <p> I was raised in North Philly and now study computer science at Drexel University. I am all about saving money, especially since the majority of my money goes towards food! That is why I was interested in being the design manager in the development of LunchBox. Pro-tip:<a target="_blank" HREF="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/72068/chicken-katsu/">chicken katsu</a> is actually really easy and inexpensive to make.</p>

                        <p>I'm from Honolulu, Hawaii studying computer science at Drexel. For Lunchbox I am one of the developers and also the scribe for the team. Outside of class I enjoy going to the beach and jammin out with friends on the guitar. My favorite recipe is <a target="_blank" HREF="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/49785/spam-musubi/"> spam musubi</a> trust me it's good even if you have never had spam.</p>
