        <h2>History of LunchBox</h2>
        <b><p>The team at LunchBox were all freshmen at Drexel University studying Computer Science and Information Systems. They all had a common goal and came together to create this web application. As inexperienced college freshmen, the team wanted to be able to cook for themselves since dining hall food is not great and have a space to share ingredients that they have made themselves in their dorms. Join other young adults by using LunchBox, the web app that helps you create a healthy balanced meal.</p></b>

                            <p> I'm from Somerset, NJ but originally from Poland. Outside of going to classes and doing work I enjoy cooking, walking around the city, and of course watching Netflix. At Drexel I am majoring information systems with a minor in technology innovation management. At LunchBox I am the project manager. My favorite recipe at the moment is the <a target="_blank" HREF="https://therecipecritic.com/2015/02/cherry-cheesecake-brownies/"> Cherry Cheesecake Brownies!</a></p>

                        <p>From Philly, PA born and raised. I am majoring in information systems and just trying to make it through life as calmly as possible. Outside of school, I enjoy baking, volunteering at the library, and traveling around the city. I believe that life is too meaningless if one isn't up and going. For LunchBox, I work as the data analyst and status coordinator.

                        <p> I am currently studying computer science at Drexel Unviersity, planning to concentrate in software engineering and artificial intelligence. I also plan on minoring in data science! I grew up eating Fujianese food, but probably one of my favorite things to eat is probably a good hefty bowl of <a target="_blank" HREF="http://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/easy-stove-top-macaroni-cheese-60350">macaroni and cheese</a> from Grey Dog in New York and while their recipe isn't online, this one is really close to it!</p>

                        <p> I am currently studying Computer Science at Drexel University and I am interested in Software Engineering. At home I ate both Vietnamese and Chinese cuisine, but my favorite cuisine is definitely Mexican food. My favorite Mexican food truck on campus is called Cucina Zapata, they have the best chicken katsu. For those who aren't able to visit the truck in person, don't fret, <a target="_blank" HREF="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/72068/chicken-katsu/">chicken katsu</a> is very easy to make at home! </p>

                        <p>I'm from Honolulu, Hawaii studying computer science at Drexel. For Lunchbox I am one of the developers and also the scribe for the team. Outside of class I enjoy going to the beach and jammin out with friends on the guitar. My favorite recipe is <a target="_blank" HREF="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/49785/spam-musubi/"> spam musubi</a> trust me it's good even if you have never had spam.</p>
